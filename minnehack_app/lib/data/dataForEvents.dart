        'Meeting face to face with your members of Congress and their staff.'
        'Writing persuasive opinion pieces in the media.'

        'No advocacy experience? No problem. RESULTS provides comprehensive issue and advocacy skills training to all volunteers.'
        'We’ve been doing this for 40 years, and we know that change doesn’t happen just because we vote. It happens because you tell your members of Congress what you care about and what they can do about it. It happens because you make calls, you write letters, and you meet with decision makers face to face. Change happens because you demand it to happen.'
        'What are you waiting for?'
        'Step up. Speak out. Become a RESULTS advocate.'
